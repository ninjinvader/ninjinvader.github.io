Created for **World Geo religion project** from Gabe's 9th grade World Geography class. Enjoy! About the Aztecs. (Note: sound effects may not be working due to HTML5). 

**NOTE:** This is a demo, more of a visual art project, not so much a game.


**HOW TO PLAY:**

All you need for this experience/project is your **mouse**.
