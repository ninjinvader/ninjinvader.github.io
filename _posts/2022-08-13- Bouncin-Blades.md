Welcome to **Bouncin' Blades**! Play as the fearsome, swashbuckling Captain Corkscrew and slay the ravenous sea creatures set on destroying you and your ship! Drink strong transformative liquors before each battle to upgrade and aquire abilities! 

Capt. Corkscrew has been magically granted the ability to slip and slide across his deck and bounce off of the railing and barrels! (He might just be drunk)

Use **Left Click** to move or change directions, but only when your charge bar is full- the blue one with the little crosshair icon.
Use **Space** to slow down to a crawl, but only when your stop bar is full- the red one with the little stop sign icon.
