Very harsh game about sailing the seven seas. Upgrade your poor ship into a beast to be feared! Rumor has it Captain Corkscrew runs this ship...
Anyway, dodge the cannon towers, and destroy the enemy ships and swimmers!


**HOW TO PLAY:**

All you need to play this game is your **mouse**. There is a short tutorial at the start.
