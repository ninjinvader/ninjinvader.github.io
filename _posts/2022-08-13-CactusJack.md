**SOMEONE PLEASE STOP CACTUS JACK!** He's been terrorizing the Wild West for years, someone put an end to his mischievous and unpredictable antics! He uses randomized attack combinations to make anyone who stands in his way a forgotten soul of the West...

Made by Gabriel and Theo Reynolds for the 2025 Viral Glitch Game Jam by Gamemaker and GX.games!
Hopefully you like our little unpredictable boss-fighting platform/shooter game! It's pretty fun and quick!
Controls: **WASD** to move. **Arrows** to shoot. **Space** to select/restart. **Escape** to quit to menu. (you might need to zoom out to see the game fully)

All code by Gabriel Reynolds. All art by Theo and Gabriel Reynolds (mostly Theo). All sounds found for free use online (sfxr.me). All music made by Gabriel Reynolds. Jun 19 2025.
