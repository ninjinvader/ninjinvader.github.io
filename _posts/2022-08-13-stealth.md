**UNTITLED GHOST GAME!!!** SpoOoo0o0oOOky! You play as a ghost! Be sure to stay away from the ghost hunters and robot scanners! Try to get all of the blue spirits in each level to move on to the next one. If you stay in a hunter's range for too long, their **EMF scanners** will catch you! Enjoy this super short game!


HOW TO PLAY:

All you need to play this game is your keyboard. Use **WASD** to move (ou **ZQSD** pour ma famille franÃ§ais!). No other input needed, just walk on spirits to collect them.
