**WELCOME TO ROCKET-PROPELLED GIFTS!**

Who doesn't want to celebrate the holidays with a skateboard-riding Santa with an RPG who can rocket jump around snowy terrain? Hop into a new level every day of Christmas (12-24) and collect the 3 presents located in each! (And maybe some secret stars...) 

Speed through each stage and collect the presents to get the highest score and lowest time!

Made by Gabriel Reynolds for Christmas 2023. Have fun!

**Controls: A/D to move left/right, space/click to shoot and bounce yourself!**
