 **Marshmallow Madness** is a fun, randomized, and quick puzzle game about making sure your s'mores get the perfect toast! Made for my dad's birthday while in Colorado. Try to get each marshmallow to the **perfect golden color!** Burning them too far, or leaving them uncooked will lower your overall score. Some special marshmallows will make the playing field interesting...

Made for my dad's birthday, 2024.


**HOW TO PLAY:**

All you need to play this game is your **mouse**.
