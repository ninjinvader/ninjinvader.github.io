Fun educational experiment I made while in Merida, Mexico after getting inspired by this video: *"Double Pendulums are Chaoticn't"*, by 2swap on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtjb2OhEQcU 

Just set the sliders with your **mouse** and press **space** to let the simulation run! Change variables such as rope length, ball weight, angle, and even save previous test runs so you can see how just the slightest changes in each variable can affect a run!
