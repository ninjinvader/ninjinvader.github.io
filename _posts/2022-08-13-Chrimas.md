**Merry Christmas My Wonderful Family!!**

I hope this webpage finds you all in good spirits today, as I have made you all a game! That's right, one for EACH of you (It was not easy)! Maman, yours is the first one with Toadette. Mon pÃ¨re, yours is the middle one with the house. And ThÃ©o, yours is the one on the right. You'll like it! Try playing your games each first a couple times before moving on. You can press **Escape** to leave your current game and play another one. ENJOY + MERRY CHRISTMAS!!

**HOW TO PLAY:**

All you need to play these games is your keyboard. For *MAMAN*- use **arrow keys**. *FATHER* dearest, use **left** and **right** click with your **mouse**. *THEO*, you can use either **WASD** or **arrow keys** and **space**.

Remember that you can press **Escape** to leave your current game. Have a blast! I don't say it enough, but I love you all so much .

Sorry Chewie, no game for you because I don't think you would do very well...
