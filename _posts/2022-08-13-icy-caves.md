This is Icy Caves. Built this for my brother's birthday, for some reason the music won't load in! Don't think that I put no music in any of my games though. 


HOW TO PLAY:

All you need to play this game is your keyboard. Use **A & D** to move (ou **Q & D** pour ma famille fran√ßais!). Run around and press **SPACE** to jump. Try to collect coins, and avoid spikes... pretty common platformer stuff.
