This is **Icy Caves**. Built this for my brother's birthday, for some reason the music won't always load in, try reloading the page. 

**2025 Update:** Another one of my old games from easily 3-4 years ago. One of the first projects I made that was what I considered at the time to be "bigger". There are several inconsistencies with how I might approach making a game today, but I really liked it at the time.


**HOW TO PLAY:**

All you need to play this game is your keyboard. Use **A & D** to move. Run around and press **SPACE** to jump. Try to collect coins, and avoid spikes...
