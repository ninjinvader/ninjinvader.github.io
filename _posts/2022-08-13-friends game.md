An interesting game with inspiration taken from Minecraft and Terraria. Made for my two best friends. Had a fun time implementing the world generation according to the chosen seed.
*Trek to the far right to complete the game!*


**HOW TO PLAY:**

All you need to play this game is your keyboard. Set a seed before playing, then use **WASD** and **Space** to explore.
