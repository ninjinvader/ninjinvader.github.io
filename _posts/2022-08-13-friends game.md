**Merry Christmas to my BOYS!**

I hope you two are doing well today! Please take a few minutes to play this silly Christmas game I made for you guys (it took me like 4 hours). It is simple but a token of my appreciation for our lasting friendship. You guys are my anchors and #1 homies. Love you fr.

**HOW TO PLAY:**

All you need to play this game is your keyboard. Set a seed before playing, then use **WASD** and **Space** to explore. Trek to the far right to complete the game!
