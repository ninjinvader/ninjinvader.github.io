I created Adela with my younger brother for the Gamemaker Studio "New Year, New Jam" back in December 2022 - January 2023. The jam celebrated the new year with some friendly competition and a prize pool of $1,500 (I didn't win). This was one of my first projects where I felt as though it was more polished and finished, even if it isn't very long. I'll always be proud of this one. 

It's a chill puzzle game about placing Adela, her magic clones, and her faithful robots to collect and protect enchanted mushrooms. I made the music on my handpan.
