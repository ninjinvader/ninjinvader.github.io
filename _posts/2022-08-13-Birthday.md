**YO!** Made this game for my dad. There are still some bugs to work out, but overall it's really fun. Hope you enjoy.


HOW TO PLAY:

You'll need a **controller** to play this game. Use left stick to move, **right stick + right trigger**to shoot when ghosts are around! Press A to collect certain items or interact with people / objects.
