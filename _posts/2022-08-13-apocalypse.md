Here is the **Apoocalypse** game I made for a friend, it's really hard... don't lose your mind. 

**2025 update:** To be honest, this game is fairly cryptic, simple, and difficult, but when I made this back in 2022 I was only just getting started with coding, haha.
(A second version might be in the works...)


**HOW TO PLAY:**

All you need to play this game is your keyboard. Use **WASD** to move. Walk over to weapon powerups (found in the corners of the map) and press **SPACE** to collect new weapons once you have enough money.
