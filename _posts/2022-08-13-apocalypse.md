Here is the **Apoocalypse** game I made for a friend, it's really hard... don't lose your mind. Also there are no sound effects, might add those at some point...


HOW TO PLAY:

All you need to play this game is your keyboard. Use **WASD** to move (ou **ZQSD** pour ma famille fran√ßais!). Walk over to weapon powerups and press **SPACE** to collect new weapons once you have enough money.
