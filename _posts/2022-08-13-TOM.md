Play as **Batman**, and stop the Joker's (surprisingly sophisticated?) robot army before they reach Gotham and destroy it!! I hope you enjoy. There are plenty of characters from various media sprinkled in there, including someone from one of my own games on this website...

**HOW TO PLAY:**

All you need to play this game is your keyboard. Use **ZQSD** to move (**WASD**). Use **Space** to shoot / place units. Use the **Number Keys** or **Arrow Keys** to switch between selected items. You collect money by breaking robots, and you lose health by touching them! Don't let them get through to Gotham, or else you will lose!!
