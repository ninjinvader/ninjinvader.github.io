**Merry Christmas Uncle Tom and Family!**

**Hugo**- It is so great to play Brawl Stars with you, I hope you have a relaxing day! :)
**Lucas**- I also miss talking with you, we had lots of fun. Can I get your phone number? Have a great Christmas! 
**Mon Oncle et Ma Tante**- I hope you two are well and can handle your children. I wish I was in France to be with you today!


I worked very hard to make a game based on some of your favorite characters. You play as Batman, and you need to stop the Joker's robot army before they reach Gotham and destroy it!! I hope you enjoy.


**HOW TO PLAY:**

All you need to play this game is your keyboard. Use **ZQSD** to move (**WASD** for Americans). Use **Space** to shoot / place units. Use the **Number Keys** or **Arrow Keys** to switch between selected items. You collect money by breaking robots, and you lose health by touching them! Don't let them get through to Gotham, or else you will lose!!
